//! `.kicad_pcb` reader — specs/kicad_board_link.md increment C1.
//!
//! ```text
//! text ──sexpr::parse──▶ Node ──read::read──▶ Pcb ──outline::chain──▶ OutlineLoops
//! ```
//!
//! What comes out is a neutral record in metres (Y down, as the file is;
//! the sketch-frame flip belongs to the derive step) plus the board
//! outline chained into one outer loop and its cutouts. Everything the
//! reader does not understand is counted into one warning; everything
//! that would make the board silently wrong is a typed error.
//!
//! No workspace dependency and no kernel type: this crate is a
//! file-format reader, like `step-import`, and lives outside the kernel
//! layering.
