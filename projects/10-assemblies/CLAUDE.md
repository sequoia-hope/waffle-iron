# 10 — Assemblies: Agent Instructions

This sub-project is **DEFERRED**. Do not implement anything yet.

All other sub-projects must reach MVP level before assembly work begins. This directory contains placeholder documentation for future design reference.

If you've been assigned to this sub-project, check with the lead agent — you may have been assigned in error, or prerequisites may now be met.
